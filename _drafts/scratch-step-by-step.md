## Scratch Step by Step

### Basic Concepts

+ 角色: 可以根据玩家控制活动或者可以和玩家互动的东西

+ 脚本：控制角色/声音等变化的指令块

+ Stage — Shows a quick summary of your game. All active sprites and your chosen background will appear here. You can move sprites around if you like. Give your project a name in the field above this.

+ Backdrop — Here, you can select a background for your game. Choose from Scratch’s library, paint your own, or import a file. You can also grab an image from your PC’s camera, though most people probably won’t need this option.

+ Sprites — The center for all the sprites in your project. Like backdrops, you can add default ones, create your own, or upload images. Click the little blue i icon on a sprite to rename it, change its angle, or hide it.

+ Work Area — Where the bulk of your work in Scratch takes place. Use the tabs above (labeled Scripts, Costumes, and Sounds to change what you’re working on.
    - Scripts - is for adding blocks of code, which we’ll cover soon.
    - Costumes - lets you create additional poses for your sprites. This tab will change to Backdrops if you have one selected in area 2, and back to Costumes when you select a Sprite in area 6. A basic image editor lets you make changes to graphics in your game. You can rename assets here too.
    - Sounds - unsurprisingly, is the center for adding and editing sounds.
+ Blocks — Depending on which of the three tabs you’ve selected, this area will switch between code blocks, sprite costumes/backdrops, and sound clips.
Control Buttons — The green flag starts your game, while the red stop sign shape ends it. You’ll use these for testing.
